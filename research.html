<p>In such systems, logic is encoded using the phase of oscillatory signals,
rather than voltage levels.  Such phase encoding has long been used in radio
communication for its <b>superior noise immunity</b>; we show that it can also be used

<h3>Encoding Bits Using Phase </h3>

<img src="figures/phase_logic.png" alt="phase_logic" width="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>\(\longleftarrow\) Logic values, 0 or 1, can be encoded in the relative phase
differences from a reference signal.</p>
<p>Phase-based encoding features inherently superior noise immunity over
level-based encoding.  A quick analogy is the use of phase and frequency
modulation over amplitude modulation in radio communication for better
resistance to noise and interferences.
This advantage of phase encoding, although having been known in communication
for a long time, is yet to be fully exploited in computation.</p>

<h3>Sub-harmonic Injection Locking (SHIL) and Oscillator Latch </h3>

oscillating perturbation in both frequency and phase; IL is a general and
intriguing phenomenon observed in all nonlinear oscillators, and is widely used
in engineering.</p>

<img src="figures/SHIL-bistable-phase-locks-adjusted.gif" alt="SHIL-bistable-phase" width="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>When the perturbation oscillates at integer multiples of the oscillator's
natural frequency, through the mechanism of Sub-harmonic Injection
Locking (SHIL), the oscillator's phase can lock to the input with multistable
sub-harmonic phase-locked responses, which can then be used to encode and store
logic bits, making the oscillator behave as a logic latch.
For example, a binary latch can be implemented by perturbing an oscillator with
a small periodic signal at about twice its natural frequency.
The oscillator will develop bistable responses with a phase difference of
\(180^\circ\), representing 0 and 1 in phase encoding.</p>

<h3>Theory and Design Tools </h3>
<p>A long standing obstacle in the study of oscillator-based systems is the
difficulty in analyzing and understanding injection locking.
Our work on RF circuit simulation over the years has shed light on this topic,
leading to the development of theory and design tools suitable for the
practical design of oscillator-based computation systems.</p>

<td align="left"><p>The dynamics of an oscillator's phase can be captured accurately and
efficiently using the phase macromodel of the oscillator.
Based on it, we have developed the Generalized Adler's Equation (GAE), that can
accurately predict the locking range of both IL and SHIL.</p>

<td align="left"><p>Phase macromodels are also important in predicting the speed at which
an oscillator's phase switches between logic 0 and 1.

<h3>Oscillator-based Finite State Machines and Ising Machines</h3>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="figures/LC-FSM.png" alt="LC-FSM" width="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>Other than oscillator latches, we also need logic gates for general-purpose
computation.
MAJORITY and NOT gates constitute a logically complete set.
Both can be conveniently implemented with phase logic:
NOT by inversion or delay by \(180^\circ\);
MAJORITY by adding input signals such that the phase of the output will pick
the majority of the input phases.
Putting all these components together, we can then implement Finite State
Machines (FSMs) that operate completely using phase encoding.</p>

<img src="figures/MAXCUT_G22.png" alt="MAXCUT_G22" width="300px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>While classical computational models such as FSMs are powerful and ubiquitous,
they are not very suitable for many computational tasks, <i>e.g.</i>, Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) problems, many graph-related optimization problems, prime
factorization, <i>etc.</i>.
Many of these problems can be mapped to finding the ground states of the
corresponding Ising Hamiltonians, and can be solved more efficiently using
Ising machines.
Our work shows that oscillators are a natural choice for implementing Ising
machines.
The bistability in oscillator latches can be modulated with the strength of
SHIL &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; from phase-noise-induced random number generation without SHIL, to
latching a definitive binary value with strong SHIL.
Anywhere in between, the oscillator encodes 0 or 1 with a probability
determined by its coupling with other oscillators.
Such controllable random number generation "agents", when coupled properly,
can encode the ground states of an Ising Hamiltonian, making the coupled
oscillator network a practical Ising machine.</p>

<h2>Device Compact Modelling</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="figures/structure.jpg" alt="structure" width="240px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>A long-standing barrier to research in models and algorithms for
continuous-time simulation has been the lack of a powerful yet convenient
platform for prototyping new ideas.
To address this issue, we have developed the Model and Algorithm Prototyping
Platform (MAPP).
MAPP's modular structuring makes it possible to add a new device with only
minimal knowledge of simulation algorithms; similarly, new simulation
algorithms can be added easily, with little knowledge of the details of the
devices in MAPP.
MAPP has been released as open source on <a href="https://github.com/jaijeet/MAPP/wiki" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>GitHub</a> under the GNU Public License.</p>

(MIT ring resonator, Purdue micro-ring frequency comb, Berkeley VCSEL, <i>etc.</i>),
spintronic devices (MTJ, piezomagnetic spin torque oscillator, <i>etc.</i>), and
other devices (RRAM/memrisors, ESD clamps, magnetic cores, <i>etc.</i>).

The result is <a href="https://github.com/jaijeet/BMM" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>BMM</a> &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; a collection of

Therefore, it is often not a feasible option if one wants to deploy new devices

We have been able to develop several types of automatic compact model
generation techniques, utilizing spline interpolations, Chebyshev expansions,

Not only can we automate the modelling process, the resulting table-based and

numerical properties such as smoothness and differentiability over the

<p>At the end, here is a graph showing the slowdown of Moore's Law, as well as
several technology trends for computing with their "hotness" over time,
measured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>N-gram</a> data from
<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Google Books</a>.
I believe that the exploration of any of them, be it graphene or CNT,
spintronics or silicon photonics, cannot thrive without an integration of
knowledge from devices modelling, simulation algorithms and system-level
design.
And it is in these areas where I plan to continue my research.</p>
