<h2>EE128/ME134, Feedback Control Systems, Spring 2017 [<a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee128/sp17" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>link</a>]</h2>
<p>This is an undergraduate class on control theory and engineering, attended
mainly by EECS and ME students in their senior year.
Other than duties related to discussions, office hours, homeworks and exams, my
main job was to teach the lab sections.
Check out below some of the cool projects my students were able to complete
through the course of the class.</p>

<p>The lead-lag control for the magnetic levitation is done entirely using analog
circuits, made with op-amps and passive devices on a breadboard.
An LED and a photoresistor are used to sense the height of the object; a
current amplifier is used to control the magnetic core.</p>
<p>Another interesting project is the inverted pendulum. Here is a video showing a
self-erecting inverted pendulum.</p>

<h2>EE219A, Numerical Simulation and Modelling, Fall 2015 [<a href="http://potol.eecs.berkeley.edu/classWiki/tiki-index.php?page=EECS219A-Fall-2015" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>link</a>]</h2>
<p>This course provides a detailed introduction to numerical simulation and
modelling mainly to first-year graduate students and senior undergrads.</p>
<p>I gave several full length lectures for this course, including one on the
modelling of common nonlinear electronic devices, one on the Newton-Raphson
algorithm, and one on the APIs of Differential Algebraic Equation objects.</p>
<p>The course emphasizes hands-on programming and application to several domains,
including circuits, nanotechnology, and biology. </p>
