100 words for MAPP

A long-standing barrier to research in models and algorithms for
continuous-time simulation has been the lack of a powerful yet convenient
platform for prototyping new ideas.
To address this issue, we have developed the Model and Algorithm Protyping
Platform (MAPP).
MAPP's modular structuring makes it possible to add a new device with only
minimal knowledge of simulation algorithms; similarly, new simulation
algorithms can be added easily, with little knowledge of the details of the
devices in MAPP.
MAPP has been released as open source on gitHUB under the GNU Public License.

80 words for models, MVS, optical

We have been able to prototype, test and debug many device compact models
with the help of MAPP, including various models for MOSFETs (BSIM, PSP, MVS,
MIT/Purdue Fe-FET models, resonate body transistor, /etc./), optical devices
(MIT ring resonator, Purdue micro-ring frequency comb, Berkeley VCSEL, /etc./),
spintronic devices (MTJ, piezomagnetic spin torque oscillator, /etc./), and
other devices (RRAM/memrisors, ESD clamps, magnetic cores, /etc./).
Device models in MAPP are specified in an executable format --- ModSpec, which
is designed to work with devices and systems from multiple
physical domains, i.e., MAPP/ModSpec is not limited to, e.g., just electrical
circuits.

100 words for memristor, ESD

Existing models for memristors all suffer from problems associated with
mathematical ill-posedness, thus do not work well in simulation, /e.g./, 
[https://knowm.org/well-posed-memristor-modeling-with-xyce-and-verilog-a/ none
generates usable DC operating points for circuit design].
We have been able to identify the problem, show the proper way of modelling
hysteresis using internal state variables, and provide proper implementations
of the models in both ModSpec and Verilog-A (an industry-standard compact
modelling language).
The result is [https://github.com/jaijeet/BMM BMM] --- a collection of
well-posed memristor models.
Furthermore, the general formalism for modelling hysteresis can be applied to
ESD protection devices as well.
[https://github.com/jaijeet/BESD BESD] is a collection of models that use only
smooth and continuous functions to capture the ESD snapback phenomenon, which
previously required the use of if-else statements and often caused convergence
problems.

phase-based modelling techniques for analyzing properties of injection locking,
speeding up oscillator simulation and characterizing oscillator's quality
factor.

During his internship at Sandia National Labs in 2013, he studied all the
existing methods for multi-tone harmonic balance, formulated a unifying
algorithm and implemented it in Sandia's internal simulator.
The code structure and input syntax for multi-tone HB he designed during the
internship have been adopted Sandia's open-source simulator Xyce since release
6.2.
During his internship at Cadence Design Systems in 2016, he conducted in-depth
research into a new type of circuit simulation algorithms named Stochastic
Steady State and Stochastic AC analyses, which offer potentials in several
magnitudes of speedup for noise simulation of sigma-delta ADCs and digital
PLLs. As a result, Cadence is devoting more manpower to further develop these
analyses.
